# Scala + OpenUI5 Demo

The demo is an initial attempt to create a Scala application that uses OpenUI5 for its user interface.  The idea is for developers to follow this workflow:

1. Use the SAP Scala Façade Generator tool to create the required OpenUI5 façade files.  (This tool is in the process of being mode Open Source, but until such time as this process is complete, the tool can be found here )
